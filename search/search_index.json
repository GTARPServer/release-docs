This makes it very easy to include example HTML source code using Markdown -- just paste it and indent it, and Markdown will handle the hassle of encoding the ampersands and angle brackets. For example, this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;div class=\"footer\"&gt;\n    &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Regular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks.
